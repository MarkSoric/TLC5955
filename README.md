# Arduino Library for the TLC5955 LED controller
This library is designed to work with the TLC5955 LED controller chip from Texas Instruments.
It can also be configured to work with many other LED driver chips from the TLC59** family
using the #define values in the header file. Tested to work with the Arduino MEGA and Teensy 3.2, but should work
with any Arduino/Genuino microcontroller or similar.
